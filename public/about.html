<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>In an increasingly interconnected world, the value of an international education transcends geographical boundaries. 
  As a Computer Science major at the Catholic University of America coming from Kenya, my academic journey represents 
  not just a personal pursuit of higher knowledge but a commitment to utilizing my skills for positive change, 
  both locally and globally. This essay outlines how my international education will serve as a catalyst for empowering 
  the youth in my home country, Kenya, through the establishment of a software company.</p>

<p>The diverse academic environment at the Catholic University of America has equipped me with a global perspective on 
  technology and its applications. Engaging with students from various cultural backgrounds has broadened my understanding 
  of how technology intersects with different societal needs. This exposure is invaluable, as it allows me to appreciate 
  the universality of certain technological solutions while also recognizing the importance of applying them to local contexts.</p>

<p>Moreover, my coursework in Computer Science has provided me with a great foundation in cutting-edge technologies 
  and programming languages. The hands-on experience gained through in class projects has honed my problem-solving 
  skills and fostered creativity in finding solutions. This skill set, acquired through an international education, 
  will be instrumental in establishing and managing a successful software company back in Kenya.</p>
