<h2> My top 5 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3> Dune </h3>
<p> This is definetly top 5 science fiction movies of all time for me </p>
<h3> Arrival</h3>
<p> Top three for me. Everything in the film is great. The acting, the story, the cinematography, the world building and everything else. Definelty a must watch for every science fiction film lover</p>
<h3> Blade Runner 2049 </h3>
<p> Another Denis Villenuve film. But for absolutely right reason. This is quite possibly the most gorgeous film ever made. Great actor, Insanely amazing world bulding. Denis builds a world and creates an ambiance that you can absolutely dissappear into.</p>
<h3> Prisoners </h3>
<p> This is the best visual execution of a story that i have ever seen. No frame is wasted, no dialogue is wasted. </p>
<h3> Insterstellar </h3>
<p> A classic. No ones says that this is a bad movie. A banger blockbuster from a banger director</p>
